==========

WADL Walker is a simple python module to walk WADL APIs. At the moment I'm targetting python3.4 and https://api.launchpad.net/devel/ WADL api point. At the moment, i'm not even downloading nor parsing WADL ;-) hence it's a very j-walking Walker. Ideally this module will gain aouth signing capabilities and become a minimalist python-launchpadlib replacement.
